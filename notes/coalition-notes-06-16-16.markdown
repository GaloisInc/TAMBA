Intro
=====

Not a lot of computation in the queries that they are demoing.

  Dave A., concern: Without a lot of computation we may not be able to 'show off'
  some of the key technologies of the program.


  Karen, response: Not the point, the types of queries we're looking at are the
  ones that PACFleet has shown interest in. A lot of the more basic queries that
  can be posed in the COP interface are the types of things that would _feed_
  into more complex queries like resource allocation 

Personel Deployment
===================

Karen: 

  * Is there enough data to support differential privacy?
  * Reuse of some of the allocation technologies?
  * Focus more on personal information (about people) instead of nation-state
    secrets


Question:

  * Wouldn't this make it a good _challenge_ problem for DP? Since there is
    less information to 'hide' in.
        
Evacuation Planning
===================

Karen:

  * Looking at the problem of marshalling evacuees to a camp and then home

This scenario will likely have _lots_ of data.

Disease Outbreak
================

Dave: Possible treat the problem as a game.

  * A large amount of info about outbreaks
  * A large amount of info about people

  Dynamic programming or linear programming, with an iterative nature to
  solving the problem. The model could develope as you solve the problem
  instead of needing to build a model up-front.

Scenario Criteria
=================

Galois TA1:
-----------

  Build a scenario that _uses_ data instead of just access/noaccess to data.

  They prefer the outbreak scenario over the others: Outbreak is great,
  others are okay.
