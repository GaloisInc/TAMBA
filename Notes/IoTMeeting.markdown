Sharad hurt his back and will not be present.

Primarily going over the plans for the F2F (not the PI meeting!).

Norman from CMU and Roberto from UCI are the only attendees.

1:40 PM
-------

Now Nalini has joined.

She is not sure if any other UCI people will be able to join.

Norman:

  Lots of progress has been made on his work, he is looking forward to the meeting on the 11th.

  He'd like to propose a field study with the UCI people. Nalini suggests
having someone stay a day longer at the F2F to plan this.


Norman is now emailing a few people


-----------------------------

Nalini: Sharad is unable to move, likely a herniated disk, but they're putting him on the call anyway!

Sharad: They've implemented a policy manager

Norman: is it working now?

Roberto: Simple enforcment, but it's working. They already implemented the
  ability to fetch and store the poicy, then enforce it.

Norman: It would be nice to have a walkthrough at the F2F about what has been implemented and how.

Discussion of policy language
-----------------------------

Sharad is asking norman for a specification of what is required in a policy language


Norman: we've taken an incremental approach.

  Multiple dimensions to language question: Expressiveness, remain incremental
  and add dimensions and attributes as needed

  He plans to take a look at commercial products this summer and see how they deal with these issues.

Sharad: Is it too early to have an hour walkthrough at the F2F

Norman: We can have an informal conversation about it at the F2F

  He thinks that the conversation will lead to a realization that this has many aspects to it.
  Manyof us are looking at the privacy language from different angles
  at CMU it's the human centered approach
  another perspective is alignment with hardware/software 

Sharad: It's important to have a notion of what a policy means

Nalini: It's hard to come up with something generic

Norman: I think it's good to use the F2F to understand where people are comming
  from instead of a specific specification

Access control
==============

Norman argues that the access control is the way to go from the Human Centered Design perspective

Sharad and Jose: talk about leakage and that notion being important in policy

Norman says he's "on board" but not there yet.

Sharad: Policy says if I'm in the smoking lounge I don't want people to know I'm there

  If I only express this policy as access control then whenever the location is hidden,
  then the adversary knows where I am!

  Therefore the notion of leakage is importat

  Differential privacy can help here too

  If I look at policy, policy languages, can users express this policy; how does
  it translate to sensor systems

Norman: There are several issues here
  one is the language presented to the user?
  How do you enforce these preferences?
  How do you discover that providing information contributes to your use of privacy budget?

Norman: Let's make this a session?

  agreement all around.

Meeting planning
================

Nalini: How many parallel working groups will there be?

  Maybe we should all participate in the policy discussion?
  As long as it's moderated (yes!)

Sharad: Let's convert this from 'show and tell' into a meeting about research integration

Norman: Sure, but let's have groups present what open questions they'd like resolved at the meeting.

  Then in the afternoon we can focus on the future.

Nalini: Two slides for each group

  1. How could we make the scenario into a demonstration (This is what Stephen wrote up alread)
  2. What are the open issues?

Sharad: What if we send an email that we need two things

  1. Broad level plan of integration, what are teh connections? We can make
    this more concrete in the mornign of the 11th
  2. What are the open questions/issues plans for past October

Then the afternoon we can talk about policies.

Norman: Okay I'll resend the agenda with some new instructions

  In the morning presentations identify where you are and what you're open issues are
  and what you're plans are past October, and what would you like to discuss in the afternoon

  Then we identify what groups would be useful in the afternoon.
