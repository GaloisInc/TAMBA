SRI Meeting Notes

Operation Damayan as Inspiration for Brandeis Enterprise Use Case(s)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Event: Typhoon Haiyan/Yolanda
  (The largest typhoon to hit land)

    * 6 million displaced
    * 11 million affected regionally
    * catastrophic destruction in one area
    * Tacloban <- One of the most severely hit.
    * Population: 200,000
    * Almost entire city destroyed
    * Widespread looting
    * Relief convoyes attacked
    * curfews imposed
    * Martial law considered

Many many countries provided aide in the aftermath (including non-allies, e.g. UK/US + China)

Lots of confusion in aftermath:
  Tacloban was where much of the help converged, though it was not where most
  of the help was needed!

  Reasons: Press and NGOs were already there, so additional aide went to where
           they knew there was an issue (they knew because of press, etc.)

  Who, what, when, where, and how

1st step towards solution -> Multinational Fusion & Coordination Center
  
Located in Manila (not near affected area)
  This is good because:
    * Infrastrusture was still available
    * Certain incompatibilities were avoided (radios from different regions don't work togehter, e.g. Australia vs. US)

Stock Exchange-like trading and negotiation regarding coordination
    * This is because countries come in with different agendas, they don't want to step on each other's toes, but
      they also want to make sure their individual goals are met
    * This problem doens't solve itself with time, more countries join the effort as time goes on

    * These decisions are made by 'Country Liaisons', some are trained in this
      practice, others were sent in an ad hoc fashion

      (Stephen asked a question about whether there were exchanges of favors)
    * Not so much 'tit-for-tat', more of a self-organising distribution of
      duties i.e. "I have supplies that need to get to X, but can't deliver it,
      can someone do that?"

      (Dave Archer posses whether this is more like an auction)
    * As opposed to linear optimisation (where you know all your needs upfront)
    * Response: Both are going on.
        * Sometimes requirements were known one day, planning happened at night
          and then in the morning the plan was undertaken
        * Other times needs are dealt with as they are made known more like an 'auction'

      (Stephen asks about what guidance was given to the liaisons about information sharing)
    * Problem: There doesn't seem to be a 'sharing policy' so to speak

      Response: It's not that there aren't policies, it's just that the
                policies aren't always well formed beforehand.  There were
                annecdotes about regrets of sharing too much AND sharing too
                little

Some examples of privacy concerns:

    * Extent of Damage

    * Philippine government response (to avoid looking bad and to avoid
      flareups of violence (Harder to loot convoy when you don't know where
      they're headed))

    * Locations and activities of forces (all countries/groups)
        Helicopters had trouble landing because people would crowd landing pad
        hoping for food/water.

    * Extent/type of help provided

Sample Coordination Situations:

    * Coordinate with local gov.

    * Optimize delivery of relief

    * De-conflict operations in affected areas

    * Evacuate/relocate victims (thousands) to _multiple_ locations

    * Provide emergency medical care

    * Transporting supplies _for other countries_

    * Ensure adequate force protection

    * Air traffic control

    * Coordinate with NGOs

These groups _do not_ like the automation of these decisions (Karen pointed
this out)

    * Stephen: When deploy SMC for smaller optimisation problems, not for the
      full resource allocation problem


Dave Archer wonders: Is what we want to design an automated player for 'Pandemic' (The boardgame)
