Abstract:
Quantitative information flow is concerned with measuring the knowledge about secret data that is gained by observing the answer to a query. This measurement has important applications in the domain of privacy, as an increase in attacker knowledge corresponds to a decrease in the privacy of a user's data. We present a novel combination of probabilistic abstract interpretation and sampling that can compute high-confidence upper bounds on information flow more accurately and more efficiently than prior methods.  The technique first computes a sound but imprecise upper bound and then uses sampling to refine this bound, delivering a superior accuracy / efficiency tradeoff as compared to either abstract interpretation or sampling in isolation.  Furthermore, we implement a number of heuristics to improve the first phase of this algorithm, which are directly applicable to existing abstract interpretation based methods.  We present detailed experimental results that quantify the improvement due to each of these factors and highlight which sorts of queries benefit most from which techniques.  Combined, these methods allow us to automatically obtain bounds for problems that are computationally infeasible for other approaches.
