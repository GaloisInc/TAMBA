This repo contains the code and some notes on background reading for the TAMBA
group of the Brandeis project.

The code should work with any Haskell install that conforms to Haskell '98.
This may change in the future as the implementation becomes more sophisticated.

Initially we are exploring how the work on g-Functions can guide our intuitions
about privacy. The initial exploratory code is found in Code/MILGF/Main.hs

Below is an example ghci session:

$ ghci Main.lhs
λ -> let myC = chanelize q1 (0,100)
λ -> let (myX, myY, myM) = myC
λ -> let myPi = uniPrior myC
λ -> vuln myC myPi -- Calculate the prior vulnerability of query `q1`
9.900990099009901e-3
λ -> minLeakage myPi myC
1.0
